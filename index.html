        <p><strong>"Innovation is when people come up with new and smart ideas to make things better. It can be a cool invention, a faster way to do something, or a fun new way to solve a problem. Just like how superheroes find clever ways to save the day, innovation helps make life easier and more exciting!"</strong></p>
        
        <h3>The wheel is one of the simplest yet most powerful innovations! üõû</h3>
        <p>Before wheels, people had to carry heavy things or drag them on the ground. But with a round wheel, they could roll things easily, making travel and work much faster. Today, wheels are everywhere‚Äîin cars, bikes, machines, and even clocks!</p>

        <h3>The market stall is one of the simplest yet most impactful forms of entrepreneurship! üè™</h3>
        <p>Before big stores, people set up small stalls to sell fruits, clothes, or handmade items. This allowed them to earn money, trade goods, and grow businesses. Today, this idea has evolved into shops, online stores, and giant companies like Amazon!</p>
